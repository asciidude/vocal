# Vocal

Vocal is a social media platform for friendly, open-minded conversations.

Far too often have we seen an increase in hostility, anger, division, and general hatefulness online. We want to offer something different—a community of people to form a genuine connection with.

- Groups, which can be...
    - **Public:** Anyone can join
    - **Admin Approval:** Anyone can join as long as they're approved by the admin
    - **Private Approval:** Only selected people by the group operator can join, sort of like a shared account
- Strict community standards which our moderation team upholds to their best extent to keep the environment safe, inclusive, and welcoming
- No ads or sponsored content
- A cheap premium subscription
    - This is to avoid paid advertisements, but is still affordable and will not directly interfere with site functionality
