# Vocal

Vocal is a social media platform for friendly, open-minded conversations.

Far too often have we seen an increase in hostility, anger, division, and general hatefulness online. We want to offer something different—a community of people to form a genuine connection with.

We offer:
- Groups, which can be...
    - **Public:** Anyone can join
    - **Admin Approval:** Anyone can join as long as they're approved by the admin
    - **Private Approval:** Only selected people by the group operator can join, sort of like a shared account
- Strict community standards which our moderation team upholds to their best extent to keep the environment safe, inclusive, and welcoming
-

Vocal is a blazingly fast **decentralized** and **privacy-focused** social media website. We prioritize user autonomy, privacy, and control over your data. Our mission is to create a safe and inclusive platform for all users.

## Features

- End-to-End Encryption: Your private messages are encrypted from end-to-end, meaning only you and your intended recipients can read them.

- Decentralized Architecture: Unlike traditional social platforms, our decentralized design prevents any single entity from controlling or accessing all user data.

- No Tracking or Profiling: We don't track your behavior, build advertising profiles, or sell your data to third parties.

- Data Minimization: We only collect the information necessary to provide our service, nothing more.

- Community Standards: We have strict community standards that ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all users.
